### Once upon a time ...

```{r}
```

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away. There lived a dragon.

*** 

#### Comments

* Dragons are not real animals. 
    - There are electric eels, but I don't know about any fire-breathing animals.
* We need to be more specific about the year. Once-upon-a-time is too vague.
    - Suggestion 1: 1280 AD
    - Suggestion 2: Roman Era. But did they have dragons?
    - But not a lava-filled pre-historic time. 

### The Princess

The princess loved unicorns, but not princes.

#### Marketing rationale

Loving unicorns is actually pretty common. I've known little girls who loved unicorns. This should be excellent market placement for our story.

#### Comments/Questions

* Are we being too heteronormative to make this about princesses and princes. 
* Will the sex police read too much into the unicorn? Maybe a pony would be better.
* The water-color ~~dragon~~ unicorn with a rainbow really removes this from any historical context.
    - We need a unicorn in a genuine historical setting.
* Get a landscape unicorn picture. This one hides the narrative.

Big Macs. But in order to be able to feed the ~~dragon~~ unicorn, they need to be cheap. So where to set this drama?

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
Big_mac <- read_csv("../data/big-mac-index.csv")
countries <- c("Sweden", "Norway", "Russia", "United States", "Korea", "Japan", "Malaysia", "India", "China", "Pakistan", "Taiwan", "Britain", "Ecuador", "Argentina")
Just_my_countries <-
  Big_mac %>%
  filter(name %in% countries) %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date), month = lubridate::month(date)) %>%
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  select(name, month, dollar_price) %>%
  tidyr::spread(key = month, value = dollar_price) %>%
  mutate(name = reorder(name, `7`, I) )
My_graphic <- 
  ggplot(data = Just_my_countries, aes(y = name)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = `1`, xend = `7`, y = name, yend = name)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = `1`), color = "red", size = 5) +
  geom_point(aes(x = `7`), color = "blue", size = 5) +
  labs(x = "Price in USD")
My_graphic
```

#### Comments

* This will encourage the readers to become data scientists.
* Make sure cross-marketing deal is in place with McD.....lds

### To control the unicorn, the princess used Shiny.

```{r}
radioButtons("food", "Feed the unicorn", c("hay", "corn", "kibble", "Big Mac"))
sliderInput("amount_of_food", "How much? (handfuls)", min = 0, max = 20, value = 10)
```
